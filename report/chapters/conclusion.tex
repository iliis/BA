This work has shown that running photometric odometry on a computationally
constrained platform is feasible and a perfomance of 5 Hz can be achieved by
running semi-global matching on the FPGA and a few optimizations, mainly early
abort in the image pyramid.

It also shows clearly, that there is still a big potential for moving even more
parts onto the FPGA to one day achieve odometry out-of-the (small and lightweight) box.
