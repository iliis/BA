- timings
- a few notes about simulation
- qualitiative evaluation
    - circles

    To assess the accuracy of photometric odoemtry, [We/I] ran in circles and measured the final offset. For high quality depth images, generated offline by OpenCV [insert exact algo here] we get an error of [about 10-20cm for a circle with diam 3.5m/length=???]. Using the more noisy depth output of the FPGA, we get an error of [TODO].
