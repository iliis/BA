This work investigates how an FPGA can assist a general purpose processor to
run demanding algorithms on a computationally constrained platform. A
photometric visual odometry approach is implemented on a Xilinx Zynq-7020 ARM
CPU and integrated with an existing semi-global matching core on the FPGA
to provide accurate visual odometry at around 5 Hz. It is shown that there is
still potential in offloading work onto an FPGA or multiple cores.
