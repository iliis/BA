main points:
- dense odometry
- embedded


This work investigates how fancy visual algos. can leverage the power of an
FPGA to run that thing on an computationally constrained platform. Here, a
relatively recent way of doing visual odometry is implemented on an ARM core:
Using disparity data caculated by an FPGA from a stereo camera, a frame is
warped to the previous one by minimizing photometric error. This results in
high precision, as the full information of a frame is taken into account.
Though not the most efficient approach, it's highly parallelizable and makes
good use of the FPGA ['s stereo data].
