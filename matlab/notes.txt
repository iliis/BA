> 'direct' least squares solution?

> least squares in 3D space instead of rendering onto images
  + no odd artefacts from projecting onto image
  + no loss of points that fall outside image
    - they don't matter/help in 3D case either...
  - minimize what exactly? color difference between closest points?
  - need depth images for all frames
    + we should get them anyway from the FPGA
